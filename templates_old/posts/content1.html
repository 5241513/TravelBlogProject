                    <p class="lh-base">
                        Hsinchu City, located in the northwest of
                        Taiwan, is the central city of the Hsinchu Metropolitan
                        Area. The whole city is divided into 3 districts,
                        Xiangshan District, North District, and East District.

                        Hsinchu City is an important center of the global
                        high-tech foundry industry. In the early 1980s, the
                        Hsinchu Science and Technology Industrial Park was
                        established here, attracting investment from a large
                        number of domestic and international manufacturers and
                        emigrating much high-tech manpower, which accelerated
                        the development of Taiwan's high-tech industry.

                        Hsinchu City is an ancient city in northern
                        Taiwan, also known as "Wind City". The food is mainly
                        Taiwanese cuisine (representatives around the Temple of
                        Hsinchu City Deity), which is a fusion of provincial
                        cuisine and Hakka cuisine. Famous local snacks include
                        Hsinchu tribute balls, rice noodles, meatballs, oyster
                        omelets, rice noodles, beef noodles, and steamed buns.
                        Most of the snacks are concentrated in the Chenghuang
                        Temple and the Beimen Street business district in the
                        urban area.

                        That is an arrangement made for the
                        arrival of Christmas
                        near the Hsinchu Moat Park.
                        When the festival came in 2020, festive decorations were
                        around the East Gate in the center of Hsinchu City,
                        and even several art installations appeared in the
                        buildings near the roundabout.
                        The scenery in the photo is the bridge on the moat at
                        night.

                        On a quiet night, I strolled along the moat.
                        A light wind blew through the ends of my hair,
                        and the lights hit the road along the way.
                        I could not hear the motor and locomotive whizzing past
                        me.
                        The annoyance in my heart left like the ebb tide of the
                        sea under my feet.

                    <p class="lh-base">Near the Hsinchu Moat Park are the famous
                        Hsinchu Railway
                        Station
                        with Japanese architectural features and the business
                        district. Many
                        trendy shops and food are waiting for people to enjoy.
                        Of course,
                        McDonald's and KFC also opened in the crowd in front of
                        the train station.
                        From the train station, walk 20 minutes to see the Big
                        City Department
                        Store. In Taiwan, the number of check-ins at the Big
                        City is second only
                        to that at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. It is
                        where people in
                        Hsinchu will check in during holidays or dinners with
                        friends and colleagues.
