                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p class="lh-base">Pingtung is the southernmost county in
                        Taiwan. Because it's located in a tropical area, the
                        weather there is like spring all year. Pingtung has many
                        beautiful scenery,like the first national park of Taiwan
                        - Kenting national park and Dapeng Bay National Scenic
                        Area. Besides, there are many delicious food in
                        Pingtung, like braised pork knuckle in Wanluan and
                        bluefin tuna in Donggang.

                    <p class="lh-base">Longkeng is located in Cape Eluanbi and
                        next to the Eluanbi Park. The terrain in Longkeng is
                        composed of coral reefs, and with the erosion of the
                        sea, there are cliff landslides, canyons and fringing
                        reefs everywhere. Not only does Longkeng have special
                        terrain, Longkeng also has many kinds of birds and
                        reptiles.
                        <br />
                        <br />I have been to Alanyi and Longkeng once during the
                        field trip in senior high school. We had a two-day trip.
                        On our first day, we went to Alanyi. We started at
                        Taichung end and needed to go to Pingtung to finish the
                        Historic Trail. The first part is a very steep slope,
                        and we need to wear gloves to climb up using the rope.
                        We decided to rest and eat lunch after we walked for a
                        long time. After that, we continue the journey and walk
                        through the beach. After several hours, we completed the
                        historic trail.
                        <br />
                        <br />On our second day, we went to Longkeng, it's more
                        relaxing, and we followed the guide and listen to him
                        introducing Longkeng. During the trip, I saw the special
                        terrain in Longkeng and saw some special plants and
                        animals. If you want to go to these places, remember
                        that both of the places require reservation.
